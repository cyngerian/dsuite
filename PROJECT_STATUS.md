# Project Status

## Status Update 2024-02-27 20:00 UTC
### Recent Changes (Last 5 Interactions)
1. Migrated schema reference system:
   - Moved schema definitions to `services/transformation/src/schema/`
   - Organized into core, models, generators, and validation modules
   - Preserved original files in `zOLD_FILES` for reference
   - Aligned with project architecture plan

2. Schema System Organization:
   - `core/`: Base schema definitions for MLB data
   - `models/`: Data modeling framework and types
   - `generators/`: SQL and migration generation tools
   - `validation/`: Schema and data validation utilities

### Current State
1. Schema Management:
   - Structured schema system in place
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Ready for integration with transformation service

2. Project Organization:
   - Schema components properly placed in transformation service
   - Clear path for schema evolution
   - Foundation for database initialization

### Next Immediate Steps
1. Integration tasks:
   - Update import paths in schema files
   - Add schema validation to transformation pipeline
   - Create database initialization scripts

2. Development tasks:
   - Add unit tests for schema components
   - Document schema system usage
   - Implement schema version control

### Known Issues
1. Schema integration pending:
   - Import paths need updating
   - Tests need to be created
   - Documentation needed

## Status Update 2024-02-27 19:45 UTC
### Recent Changes (Last 5 Interactions)
1. Explored different approaches to PostgreSQL schema generation:
   - Initially created a JSON schema analysis-based generator
   - Discovered existing well-structured schema definitions in `zOLD_FILES`
   - Attempted integration with predefined schemas
   - Decided to revert back to JSON schema analysis approach

2. Set up proper version control:
   - Initialized git repository
   - Added all project files
   - Created initial commit with project structure
   - Configured git user settings

3. Established command running practices:
   - Documented command running format in `docs/GOALS.md`
   - Implemented consistent command formatting
   - Set up proper shell state tracking
   - Added command explanations and output visibility

### Current State
1. Version Control:
   - Repository initialized
   - All files committed
   - Git configuration set up

2. Project Structure:
   - `/docs`: Documentation and schema files
   - `/scripts`: Analysis and setup scripts
   - `/services`: Docker service configurations
   - `/zOLD_FILES`: Previous schema definitions (reference only)

3. Schema Analysis:
   - JSON schema analysis script in place
   - Sample data stored in docs/schema/samples
   - Previous schema definitions preserved for reference

### Next Immediate Steps
1. Continue development of PostgreSQL schema generator:
   - Enhance JSON schema analysis
   - Generate proper table relationships
   - Handle nested structures appropriately

2. Set up development environment:
   - Configure Docker services
   - Initialize MinIO buckets
   - Set up PostgreSQL database

3. Implement data ingestion:
   - Create data loading scripts
   - Set up validation
   - Implement error handling

### Known Issues
1. Schema generator needs improvement:
   - Better handling of nested structures
   - Proper relationship mapping
   - Index optimization

2. Environment setup pending:
   - Docker services not yet configured
   - Database initialization needed
   - MinIO configuration required

### Recent Changes (last 5 interactions)
1. Created schema analysis scripts in scripts/schema_analysis/
2. Added unit tests for schema analysis
3. Set up Python virtual environment with core dependencies
4. Created initial project tracking files

### Current State

2. Review and document discovered schemas
3. Plan data transformation pipeline based on schema analysis
4. Implement error handling improvements if needed

### Known Issues
None currently.
