# Phased Implementation Approach

## Overview
This document outlines our phased implementation strategy for the MLB Statistics Tracking System (STS). Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a stable and maintainable system.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

### Focus Areas
1. **Basic Data Pipeline**
   - MinIO bucket setup and configuration
   - Basic ingestion service for MLB API
   - Simple data validation
   - Basic PostgreSQL schema implementation

2. **Message Bus Foundation**
   - Kafka and Schema Registry setup
   - Basic event schemas
   - Core message topics
   - Basic producer/consumer implementations

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Basic health checks
   - Essential metrics collection
   - Simple alerting system
   - Log aggregation

### Success Criteria
- Successful ingestion of MLB game data
- Data properly stored in MinIO
- Basic event flow through message bus
- Core database tables populated
- Basic monitoring operational

## Phase 2: Feature Implementation

### Focus Areas
1. **Enhanced Data Processing**
   - Advanced data validation
   - Schema evolution handling
   - Data transformation pipeline
   - Derived statistics calculation

2. **Message Bus Enhancement**
   - Complex event processing
   - Dead letter queues
   - Event replay capability
   - Schema evolution handling

3. **API Development**
   - RESTful endpoint implementation
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Rate limiting
   - Basic caching

### Success Criteria
- Robust data processing pipeline
- Comprehensive event handling
- API endpoints operational
- Enhanced monitoring and alerting

## Phase 3: System Enhancement

### Focus Areas
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Query optimization
   - Caching strategies
   - Connection pooling
   - Load balancing

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Real-time statistics updates
   - Historical data analysis
   - Advanced metrics calculation
   - Custom data exports

3. **System Hardening**
   - Security enhancements
   - Disaster recovery
   - Backup strategies
   - Performance monitoring

### Success Criteria
- Optimized system performance
- Advanced features operational
- Robust security measures
- Comprehensive monitoring

## Implementation Guidelines

### Phase Transitions
- Each phase must meet all success criteria before moving to the next
- Documentation must be updated before phase completion
- All tests must pass with adequate coverage
- Performance benchmarks must be met

### Cross-Phase Considerations
1. **Message Bus Integration**
   - Design all components with event-driven architecture in mind
   - Plan for future event types and schemas
   - Consider message replay requirements
   - Implement proper error handling

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for all new components
   - Integration tests for service interactions
   - Performance tests for critical paths
   - Load testing for key features

3. **Documentation**
   - Update technical documentation
   - Maintain API documentation
   - Document message schemas
   - Keep deployment guides current

4. **Monitoring**
   - Add monitoring for new components
   - Update alerting rules
   - Maintain logging standards
   - Track performance metrics

## Timeline and Dependencies
Each phase is expected to take 4-6 weeks, depending on complexity and team capacity. Dependencies between phases are documented in the project management system.
