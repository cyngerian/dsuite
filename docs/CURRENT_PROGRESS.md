- ‚ùå Transformation service not implemented yet
- ‚ùå Database design not implemented yet

### 2. Development Environment

  - isort for import sorting
  - Pre-commit hooks
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline started with GitHub Actions
- ‚ùå Docker configuration not complete
- ‚ùå PostgreSQL setup not started
- üü® MinIO setup in progress

### 3. Project Structure
- ‚úÖ Basic directory structure matches plan
- ‚úÖ Documentation framework in place
- ‚úÖ Version control setup complete
- ‚úÖ Testing framework configured
- ‚ùå Service-specific configurations not implemented

   - Service orchestration
   - Environment configurations
   - Production setup

## Recommendations for Next Steps

### 1. Immediate Priority
- Complete schema analysis tools
- Implement MinIO integration
- Start PostgreSQL setup
- Begin ingestion service development

### 2. Short-term Goals
- Implement Docker configurations
- Set up basic MLB API integration
- Create initial database schemas
- Develop basic transformation logic

### 3. Medium-term Goals
- Implement API service
- Set up data pipeline
- Add comprehensive tests
- Complete documentation

## Alignment with Project Plan
We are currently in the early stages of Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure), with focus on:
- Development environment setup (mostly complete)
- Schema analysis and design (in progress)
- Basic service structure (initialized)
- CI/CD pipeline (basic implementation)

The project is following the planned structure but is still in the initial setup phase. Most of the core functionality implementation is pending, but the foundation for development is well-established with proper tooling and quality controls in place.

## Legend
- ‚úÖ Complete
